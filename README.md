- **DTO (Data Transfer Object)**: Defines request and response objects for registration and authentication.
- **Entity**: Represents the User entity, including user details and roles.
- **Repository**: Manages the persistence of User entities.
- **Security Configuration  üîê**: Configures Spring Security with JWT authentication.
- **Service ‚öôÔ∏è**: Implements business logic for user registration and authentication.
- **Security Filter**: Custom filter to intercept requests, validate JWT, and set up the authentication context.
